# Advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to single-cell level for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis
## An Alzheimer's disease diagnosis method based on the adaptive matching of fMRI samples and snRNA data.

This repository provides the Python implementation of advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to single-cell level for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (scBIT). 

The codes are divided into two parts:

**1. _scRNA embedding_**

**2. _AD diagnosis_**

The users should first utilize **_scRNA embedding_** to generate the gene subgraph embeddings for snRNA data.
