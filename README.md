# Advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to single-cell level for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis
## An Alzheimer's disease diagnosis method combining fMRI samples with scRNA data.

This repository provides the Python implementation of advancing brain imaging transcriptomics to single-cell level for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (scBIT). 
 The codes are divided into two parts:
**1. _scRNA embedding_**
**2. _AD diagnosis_**
